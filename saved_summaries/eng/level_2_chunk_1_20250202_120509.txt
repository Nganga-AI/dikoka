In the mid-1950s, Cameroon experienced heightened anti-colonial tensions as French authorities intensified efforts to suppress the Union des Populations du Cameroun (UPC), a key nationalist movement. Under Roland Pré, the French Haut-Commissaire, strategic measures were implemented to counter UPC influence amid growing independence demands. This period was characterized by increased surveillance and aggressive repression, particularly in regions like Sanaga-Maritime.

Leaders such as Achille Mbembe and Ernest Ouandié sought to galvanize resistance through political and military training, prompting French authorities to deploy armed guards from Douala and Ngambè. These forces disrupted protests and led to the arrest of around 47 UPC supporters, highlighting the violent nature of the conflict and France's determination to maintain colonial control.

These events underscored Cameroon’s broader struggle for independence, illustrating Pré's multifaceted strategy that combined administrative reforms with military actions against anti-colonial movements. This approach was part of a larger French colonial strategy during this turbulent period in mid-20th-century Africa, reflecting the complexities faced by those resisting colonial rule.

This summary aligns with previous discussions on Pré’s efforts to weaken UPC influence through pro-French factions and decentralization policies, emphasizing the persistent struggle for Cameroon's independence against international decolonization pressures.
