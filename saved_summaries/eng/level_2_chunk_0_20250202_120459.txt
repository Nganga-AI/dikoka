In mid-1950s Cameroon, anti-colonial tensions intensified as French authorities sought to suppress the Union des Populations du Cameroun (UPC). Roland Pré, the French Haut-Commissaire, played a critical role in implementing strategies aimed at countering UPC influence amidst growing demands for independence. This period was marked by strategic confrontations and repressive measures against the UPC.

Key events included increased surveillance and aggressive repression in regions like Sanaga-Maritime, where leaders such as Achille Mbembe and Ernest Ouandié attempted to mobilize resistance through political and military training. French tactics involved deploying armed guards from Douala and Ngambè to disrupt protests and arrest demonstrators, including actions leading to the imprisonment of about 47 UPC supporters.

These incidents highlight the violent nature of the conflict and France's determination to maintain colonial control in response to international decolonization pressures. The events underscored the broader struggle for Cameroon’s independence, illustrating Pré's multifaceted approach that combined administrative reforms and military measures against the anti-colonial movement.

This summary aligns with previous discussions by emphasizing Pré's strategic efforts to dilute UPC influence through fostering pro-French factions and implementing decentralizing policies. These actions were part of a broader French colonial strategy during this turbulent period, reflecting the complexities of resisting colonial rule in mid-20th-century Africa.
