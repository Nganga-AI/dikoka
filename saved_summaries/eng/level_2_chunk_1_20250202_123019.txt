In the late 1960s to early 1970s, Cameroon navigated a complex transition towards military autonomy from France, marked by efforts to assert sovereignty while managing residual colonial influences. The process culminated in complete control over its military forces by 1969. Tensions were prevalent between French and Cameroonian officers, particularly as younger Cameroonian commanders began exercising more independence, often disregarding their experienced French counterparts.

During this period, President Ahmadou Ahidjo actively sought enhanced military support from France to ensure regional stability without direct intervention. However, domestic unrest in France during 1968 delayed these efforts, complicating bilateral relations. To address the challenges of relying solely on French military training, Cameroon explored educational opportunities with other nations such as the USSR and Greece.

French involvement remained significant in certain regions like Bamiléké, where indirect support continued through logistics and preventive measures. Despite ongoing tensions over control and differing approaches to command, these agreements underscored the nuanced dynamics between seeking autonomy and maintaining established colonial ties within Cameroon's military sector during decolonization.

This phase reflects broader themes of post-independence transitions, emphasizing both the aspirations for national sovereignty and the enduring complexities of former colonial relationships in shaping new national identities.
