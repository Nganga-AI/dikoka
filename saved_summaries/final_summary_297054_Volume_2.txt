During Cameroon's transition from French colonial rule to independence between 1950s and early 1970s, several complex dynamics unfolded as both nations navigated military autonomy, control, and lingering colonial influences. In December 1960, France aimed to maintain influence over the forming Cameroonian forces through a secretive directive issued by Prime Minister Michel Debré on November 25, bypassing traditional command channels. This created friction within French military hierarchy, particularly between General Sizaire of the CIFFC and other entities, exacerbated when Sizaire learned about the instruction through delayed correspondence from Pierre Messmer in January 1961.

To address these challenges, proposals emerged for restructuring French military presence into two distinct commands: a Mixed Military Force (MMF) under the ambassador's authority and a separate Forces Françaises au Cameroun (FFC), managed by Zone Militaire n°2. This restructuring aimed to streamline operations while safeguarding France’s strategic interests as Cameroon moved towards military independence, highlighting tensions inherent in decolonization.

As Cameroon transitioned further into autonomy during the late 1960s and early 1970s, domestic unrest in France complicated bilateral relations and delayed military support initiatives pursued by President Ahmadou Ahidjo. While Cameroonian officers sought greater sovereignty and younger commanders began exercising independence from French counterparts, regional stability remained a concern. In response, Cameroon expanded its educational opportunities with nations like the USSR and Greece to reduce reliance on French training.

French influence persisted in regions such as Bamiléké, where indirect support continued through logistics and preventive measures despite ongoing tensions over control and command approaches. These dynamics underscored broader post-independence challenges, balancing aspirations for national sovereignty against enduring colonial ties.

Parallel to these military and political transitions, severe human rights abuses emerged during Cameroon's decolonization process. French-backed forces employed coercive interrogation techniques like the "kalimba" method, involving electric shocks to extract confessions under duress. Such practices were often downplayed in official reports, despite testimonies revealing widespread violence against Cameroonian political figures and continuity of colonial-era repression strategies.

This period reflects broader themes of post-independence transitions, emphasizing challenges in maintaining order while transitioning from oppressive colonial legacies. Acknowledging these historical injustices is crucial to understanding their impact on national identity formation and governance in newly independent states like Cameroon. The synthesis of military restructuring efforts, sovereignty aspirations, and human rights abuses provides a comprehensive overview of the complexities inherent in decolonization.
