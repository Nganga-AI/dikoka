The text continues to explore severe human rights abuses during Cameroon's transition from colonial rule to independence, focusing on coercive interrogation methods employed by French-backed forces, including British collaboration. Techniques like the "kalimba" method involved electric shocks aimed at extracting information with little regard for detainees' well-being. Official reports often downplayed these brutal practices, framing suspect confessions as voluntary.

Specific incidents and testimonies reveal the harsh realities of interrogation tactics, such as those at Fort Kéniéba, illustrating a pattern of violence against Cameroonian political figures that mirrors colonial repression strategies. These abuses are contextualized within efforts to establish localized police forces in post-colonial Cameroon, highlighting the challenges of maintaining order while transitioning from colonial practices.

The text emphasizes the need for acknowledging these historical injustices to fully understand this period in Cameroonian history, underscoring broader patterns of oppression and their impact on national identity and governance. This narrative fits into a larger context of grappling with colonial legacies in newly independent states.
