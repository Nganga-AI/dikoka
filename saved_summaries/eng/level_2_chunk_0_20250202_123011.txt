In December 1960, as France transitioned military control to Cameroon by January 1, 1961, significant challenges emerged, particularly highlighted in an "Instruction personnelle et secrète" issued on November 25 by French Prime Minister Michel Debré. This directive aimed to maintain French influence over the newly forming Cameroonian forces during decolonization but bypassed traditional military command channels, creating friction within the French military hierarchy.

The confusion primarily stemmed from unclear responsibilities between the Command of Forces Interarmées Françaises au Cameroun (CIFFC), led by General Sizaire, and other French military entities. This discord was exacerbated when General Sizaire only learned about the instruction through a letter dated January 2, 1961, sent by Minister Pierre Messmer, who criticized its secretive nature.

To address these challenges, there were calls for clearer delineation of command structures to prevent further conflicts. In response, Pierre Messmer proposed restructuring French military presence into two distinct commands: a Mixed Military Force (MMF) under the ambassador's authority and a separate command for Forces Françaises au Cameroun (FFC), overseen by Zone Militaire n°2 (Zom n°2). These measures aimed to streamline operations and solidify France's strategic interests as Cameroon moved towards military independence.

Overall, this period highlights the complexities and tensions inherent in decolonization, particularly regarding maintaining influence while transitioning control over military forces.
